Create a shiny app for landscape and ecological genomics

Use the navBar function in the shiny UI package. The function allowzs to create different tab

Here are the Tabs with the Submeno

1) Home page: select project folder
2) File Conversion: Convert File (vcf) for LFMM and sNMF

3) Bioclimatic Data: download and select the best bioclimatic data
	Download data: Download Data for your coordinates. Output a Table with googleVis with the coordinates on the top,
	and the table of climatic data in the lower part of it
	PCA: PCA downloaded data + Loading summary + select most representative variables

4) Population Structure:
	Modify for using TESS3 and export Q barplot and Population interpolation in the maps. Do also a selection scan and plot the manhatthan plot of the result with both Pval and 
	p-adj
	
5) Genome scan:
	Population differentiation
	LFMM

6) PostProcess data:
	Find annotated features

Improve appeareance
You can add small Icons in the differen analysis by using the icon=icon() function
Go to http://fontawesome.io/icons/ for find more icons.

See also this shiny APP created for genome analysis https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4620618/ 

You can use also TESS3 for population structure and spatial interpolation of the data
See this tutorial: https://bioshock38.github.io/TESS3_encho_sen/articles/main-vignette.html

You can load the lfmm files in this program but remeber to convert the 9 to NA

remeber to revert the Longitude and the latitude in the coordinate matrix for TESS3

Create an rds file in the previous analysis and then load it later
